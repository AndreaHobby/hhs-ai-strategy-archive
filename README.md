# HHS AI Strategy & Policy Documents Archive (2023-2025)

## Overview

This repository preserves **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) AI strategy documents and policy guidance** from the 2023-2025 period, including materials developed during my tenure as a data scientist at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).

I contributed to HHS AI strategy development as a member of the **HHS Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice**, which brought together data scientists, policy experts, and program leaders across HHS agencies to shape federal AI governance frameworks for healthcare programs.

**Purpose of this archive:**
- Preserve public policy documents from this period for researchers and practitioners
- Provide reference materials for federal AI governance frameworks
- Document the evolution of healthcare AI policy at the federal level
- Ensure continued public access to these resources

## My Role in HHS AI Strategy Development

**Position:** Data Scientist, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA/HHS)  
**Period:** December 2023 - March 2025

**Contributions to HHS AI Strategy:**
- Active member of **HHS Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice** (AI CoP)
- Participated in cross-agency working groups developing AI governance frameworks
- Contributed data science and analytics perspective to policy discussions
- Advised on algorithmic fairness, transparency, and equity considerations in federal healthcare programs
- Supported integration of AI/ML solutions into HRSA Health Center Program operations

**Context:**
During this period, HHS was developing comprehensive AI strategy and governance frameworks across its agencies (FDA, CDC, CMS, HRSA, NIH, etc.). The AI Community of Practice facilitated coordination, shared best practices, and developed unified approaches to responsible AI deployment in healthcare.

## Federal AI Policy Context (2023-2025)

This period saw significant federal activity in AI governance:

**Key Federal Actions:**
- **Executive Order 14110** (October 2023) - "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI"
- **OMB M-24-10** (March 2024) - Federal agency AI governance guidance
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework** - Applied to federal healthcare programs
- **HHS AI Strategy** - Department-wide coordination and standards

**HHS Specific Context:**
- 1,400+ Federally Qualified Health Centers using predictive analytics
- Medicare/Medicaid programs increasingly incorporating AI/ML
- FDA regulating AI/ML medical devices and clinical decision support
- NIH funding AI research in precision medicine and health equity

My work at HRSA occurred at the intersection of these policy developments and operational program needs, particularly ensuring AI systems in safety-net healthcare programs addressed health equity and patient safety.

## Relevance to Healthcare AI Governance (2025+)

While these documents reflect 2023-2025 HHS priorities, many frameworks remain relevant:

**Enduring Principles:**
- Algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation in healthcare
- Transparency and explainability requirements
- Patient safety considerations for AI systems
- Health equity implications of predictive models
- Data governance and privacy protections

**Applicable Use Cases:**
- Clinical decision support systems
- Predictive analytics for population health
- Healthcare fraud detection
- Resource allocation algorithms
- Health risk stratification models

Organizations implementing healthcare AI systems can reference these frameworks regardless of current federal policy, as they represent evidence-based best practices developed through extensive multi-agency collaboration.
